### Hi! I'm Kyle

I'm a software engineer with extensive experience as a full stack developer. You'll find me coding in TypeScript or Python 90% of the time. Professionnally I've worked for a web agency, the DHA, and as a freelancer. 

My passions lie in AI/ML, and football üèà. Last november I began a project called yac.football to try to merge the two. This has led me into a niche of LLM implementation where I'm able to venture into fascinating projects while still leveraging my full-stack experience.  

I'm always looking to add to my skillset and learn something new. These days I'm learning Rust to build native applications on my Mac. 

For one day I was a professional arena football coach (the team folded in COVID)
